## 🧠 Recommendation Engine (AI Logic)

The feed engine currently uses a **hybrid ranking system** that blends user-specific preferences with content popularity. This allows every user to see *all content from a business* ranked by relevance, rather than filtered.

### 🎯 Current Scoring Strategy

If a user has no prior interactions (cold start), content is ranked by:

```ts
score = views * 0.5 + likes * 1.5 + comments * 1.0 + shares * 2.0
````

If a user has interaction history, the engine:

1. Builds a **tag affinity vector** from past likes/comments/shares
2. Scores content based on **tag overlap**
3. Applies a **freshness boost** (decays over time)
4. Applies a **penalty** for content the user has already viewed

```ts
finalScore = tagScore + popularityScore + freshnessBoost - viewedPenalty
```

This ensures every user sees the most engaging, contextually relevant content with recency and novelty baked in.

### 🔮 Future Improvement Plan: Vector Embedding & Semantic Similarity

PearHub’s AI logic is designed to evolve. In future versions, we plan to replace tag-based ranking with **semantic vector embeddings**, allowing much smarter, ML-powered feed personalization.

#### 🧬 How it will work

- Each piece of content (title, tags, description) will be embedded using a model like OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada`
- Each user’s interaction history will form a **“taste vector”**
- Content will be scored using **cosine similarity** between vectors
- Resulting in deep contextual matching between **users and content**, far beyond exact tag overlap

This system will unlock:

- 🧠 Smarter recommendations
- 📈 Better scaling as data grows
- 🧬 ML/AI-integrated personalization
